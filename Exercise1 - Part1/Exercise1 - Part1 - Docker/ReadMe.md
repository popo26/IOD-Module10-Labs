## Exercise 7 - Swagger (Page 72)

Part 2: Add an express back-end to the Fake Store API exercise from Module 4. Your back end should use routes and controller functions to handle fetching the Fake Store data, and your front end should fetch from your back-end instead of directly from the Fake Store back end. Include these routes in your swagger.json config.

Part 2 mentioned on Page 72: Final Module Project
Using what you learnt in this module, recreate the Fake eCommerce Store that you have
created in Module 4. Move your front-end files to the public folder, and create an Express
back-end to handle all third-party data fetching using axios. Your front end should then
fetch from your back-end instead of the fake store API directly.
Make sure to make a clean MVC Structure and use Swagger to test things out, and make a
documentation that is easy to read and test.
